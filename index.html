            <h1>The Importance of Sleep</h1>

            <p>
                Getting enough sleep is <strong>very important</strong> for your overall health.
                It helps your body <em>recover and stay focused</em> throughout the day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Experts explain that sleep allows the brain to process information and repair itself.
                A doctor once said:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Sleep is not a luxury. It is a necessity for the human body and mind.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                During sleep, especially <abbr title="Rapid Eye Movement">REM</abbr> sleep,
                the brain becomes very active. One expert even called it
                <q>the brain’s maintenance mode</q>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Experts say we need at least <del>6</del> <ins>8</ins> hours of sleep every night.
            </p>
